# GrafanaJSON
Simplify and automate Grafana Dashboard generation

## Use Case
My use case is Icinga2 -> InfluxDB -> Grafana

The count of host and service checks changes regulary. I use this to automated the Dashboard generation.

Currently only InfluxDB is supported because that is what I use.
Graphite support is planned but Pull requests are welcome.
This is in very early development.
